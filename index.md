A backend dev, actively learning devops, cyber security thing and passively learning various other nerdy stuff.

I write what I learn on my blog. hope it will be helpful.

If I was not a developer I would be a traveller because I like experiencing new cultures. Somewhere in multiverse I am a traveller and I am really enjoying it.
